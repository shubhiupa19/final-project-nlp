You broke me first,1

[Verse 1],0
Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself,0
But you shoulda told me that you were thinking 'bout someone else,1
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down,1
"Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're calling me now",1

[Pre-Chorus],0
"I know you, you're like this",1
When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it,0
"And like me, I did",0
But I ran out of every reason,1
,
[Chorus],0
Now suddenly you're asking for it back,1
"Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?",1
"Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had",0
But I don't really care how bad it hurts,0
When you broke me first,1
You broke me first,1
[Verse 2],0
"Took a while, was in denial when I first heard",0
"That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt",1
"Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name",0
"But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say",1

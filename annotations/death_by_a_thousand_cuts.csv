[Chorus],0
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts,1
Flashbacks waking me up,1
"I get drunk, but it's not enough",0
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby,1
I look through the windows of this love,0
Even though we boarded them up,1
Chandelier's still flickering here,0
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,1
It's death by a thousand cuts,1
[Verse 1],0
"I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home",1
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright,1
"They say, ""I don't know""",1
And what once was ours is no one's now,1
"I see you everywhere, the only thing we share",0
Is this small town,1
"You said it was a great love, one for the ages",0
"But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?",1

[Verse 2],0
"My heart, my hips, my body, my love",1
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch,1
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug,1
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club,1
"Our songs, our films, united we stand",1
"Our country, guess it was a lawless land",1
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand,1
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans,1
"My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust",1
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up,1
"Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough",0
"But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts",1
[Chorus],0
"I get drunk, but it's not enough",0
'Cause you're not my baby,1
I look through the windows of this love,0
Even though we boarded them up,1
Chandelier's still flickering here,0
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not,1
"No, it's not",1
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch),1

[Post-Chorus],0
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch,0
"My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)",0
"But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no",1

[Outro],0
I take the long way home,1
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright,1
"They say, ""I don't know""",1

[Chorus: Adam Levine],0
"I'm at a payphone, trying to call home",1
"All of my change, I spent on you",1
"Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong",1
Where are the plans we made for two?,1
,
[Verse 1: Adam Levine],0
"Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember",0
The people we used to be,1
It's even harder to picture,0
That you're not here next to me,1
You say it's too late to make it,0
But is it too late to try?,1
And in our time that you wasted,0
All of our bridges burned down,1
,
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine],0
I've wasted my nights,1
You turned out the lights,1
Now I'm paralyzed,1
Still stuck in that time,0
"When we called it ""Love""",1
But even the sun,0
Sets in paradise,1
[Chorus: Adam Levine],0
"I'm at a payphone, trying to call home",1
All of my change I spent on you,1
"Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong",1
Where are the plans we made for two?,1
,
[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine],0
If happy-ever-after's did exist,0
I would still be holding you like this,1
All those fairytales are full of shit,1
"One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh",1
,
[Verse 2: Adam Levine],0
You turned your back on tomorrow,0
'Cause you forgot yesterday,1
I gave you my love to borrow,0
But you just gave it away,1
You can't expect me to be fine,1
I don't expect you to care,1
I know I said it before,0
But all of our bridges burned down,1
,
[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine],0
I've wasted my nights,1
You turned out the lights,1
Now I'm paralyzed,1
Still stuck in that time,0
"When we called it ""Love""",1
But even the sun,0
Sets in paradise,1
[Chorus: Adam Levine],0
"I'm at a payphone, trying to call home",1
"All of my change I spent on you (Whoa, whoa-oa)",1
"Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong",1
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah),1

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Wiz Khalifa],0
If happy-ever-after's did exist,0
I would still be holding you like this,1
And all those fairytales are full of shit,1
"One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Uh)",1
"Now, I'm at a payphone",1
,
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa],0
"Man, fuck that shit",1
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round,1
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin',1
"Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'",1
And all of my cars start with the push of a button,1
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it,1
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it,1
"Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'",1
"Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked",1
"Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot",1
So you talk about who you see at the top,1
"Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for",1
"Phantom pulled up, valet open doors",1
"Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for",1
Now it's me who they want,0
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you,1
[Chorus: Adam Levine],0
"I'm at a payphone, trying to call home",1
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!),1
"Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong",1
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?),1
(Yeah),

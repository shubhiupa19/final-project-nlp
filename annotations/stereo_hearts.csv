[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy],0
My heart's a stereo,1
"It beats for you, so listen close",1
Hear my thoughts in every no—,0
Oh—ote,1

"Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that",1
"Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks",1
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks,1
"I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that",1
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts,1

"Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?",1
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up),0
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace),1

When you have to purchase mad D batteries,1
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make,1

[Verse 1],0
This skyscraper's causing vertigo,1
The countdown begins in Tokyo,1
Twenty-seven days alone,0
Means twenty million ways to cope without you,0
[Chorus],0
"I'm in a reckless fever, love-struck girl, I'd tease her",1
Thought I'd never be her,1
"Quite the job you've done on me, sir",0
You've been hosting parties in my mind,1
I'm working overtime to have you in my world,1
"Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl",1
[Verse 2],0
"Forced to get creative, wrote my feelings down",1
The independent lady in me's nowhere to be found,1
I can't wait another day to see you,1
How embarrassing to be this way,1
[Chorus],0
"I'm in a reckless fever, love-struck girl, I'd tease her",1
Thought I'd never be her,1
"Quite the job you've done on me, sir",1
You've been hosting parties in my mind,1
I'm working overtime to have you in my world,1
"Oh, what a curse it is to be in love",1
[Bridge],0
I wait by the phone like a high school movie,1
"Dream at the shows, you'll come runnin' to me",1
"Think I see you in the wings, God",1
I'm hallucinating,1
[Chorus],0
"What a reckless fever, love-struck girl, I'd tease her",1
Thought I'd never be her,1
"Quite the job you've done on me, sir",1
You've been hosting parties in my mind,1
"I'm working overtime, you've become my whole world",1
"Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl",1

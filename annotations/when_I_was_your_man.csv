"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now",1
"Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same",1
"When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down",1
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name,0
[Pre-Chorus],0
"It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)",0
"Mm, too young, too dumb to realize",0
[Chorus],0
That I should've bought you flowers,1
And held your hand,0
Shoulda gave you all my hours,1
When I had the chance,0
Take you to every party,1
Cause all you wanted to do was dance,0
Now my baby's dancin',1
But she's dancin' with another man,0
[Verse 2],0
"Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways",0
"Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life",0
"Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh",1
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes,0

"It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)",0
"Mm, too young, too dumb to realize",0
[Chorus],0
That I should've bought you flowers,1
And held your hand,0
Shoulda gave you all my hours,1
When I had the chance,0
Take you to every party,1
Cause all you wanted to do was dance,0
Now my baby's dancin',1
But she's dancin' with another man,0
[Bridge],0
Although it hurts,0
I'll be the first to say that,0
I was wrong,1
"Oh, I know I'm probably much too late",1
To try and apologize for my mistakes,0
But I just want you to know,1
[Chorus],0
I hope he buys you flowers,1
I hope he holds your hand,1
Give you all his hours,0
When he has the chance,1
Take you to every party,1
Cause I remember how much you love to dance,0
Do all the things I should've done,0
When I was your man,1
Do all the things I should've done,0
When I was your man,1

# Edge Cases Log

## Purpose
Document ambiguous lines where annotators disagree or are unsure. We'll discuss these as a group and update the main guidelines as needed.

## Flagged Cases

### Template: 

### [Song Title] - Line X
**Line:** "..."
**Annotator:** [Your name]
**Tentative label:** 0 or 1
**Reasoning:** Why this is ambiguous
**Group decision:** [To be filled after discussion]

---

### Example: Let It Be - Line 3
**Line:** "Speaking words of wisdom, let it be"
**Annotator:** Shubhi
**Tentative label:** 1
**Reasoning:** Could be continuation of "Mother Mary comes to me" OR standalone imperative
**Group decision:** TBD

---

### Stay - Line 13
**Line**: "Something in the way you move"
**Annotator**: Shubhi
**Tentative label**: 0
**Reasoning**: Could be ending the idea of previous line of : "Not really sure how to feel about it", but also isn't a sentence ending in itself

## Resolved Patterns
(After group discussion, move resolved cases here with final decision)

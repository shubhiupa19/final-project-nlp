I missed your 21st birthday,1
I've been up at home,1
"Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should",1
Hate to picture you half-drunk happy,1
Hate to think you went out without me,1
I'm sorry if you blame me if I were you I would,1
"Thought you'd see it coming, but you never could",1
I still haven't heard from your family,0
But you said your mom always loved me,1
,
[Pre-Chorus],0
Sometimes I go blurry-eyed,1
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire,1
"Lights on and it's black and white, I couldn't stay forever",1
,
[Chorus],0
I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue,1
You'll be the love of my life when I was young,1
When the night is over,0
Don't call me up I'm already under,1
I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again,1
I'll be the love of your life inside your head,1
When the night is over,0
Don't call me up I'm already under,1

Audrey said she saw you out past twelve o'clock,1
Just because you're hurting doesn't mean I'm not,1
If it doesn't go away by the time I turn thirty,0
I made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm sorry,1
"""Sorry""",1

I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue,1
